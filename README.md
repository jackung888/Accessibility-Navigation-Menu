Navigate the menu bar with tab and arrow keys (up, down, left, right)

remember to include the jquery script into your html.
as the menu I am using a button for the dropdown menu, because it was a requirement challenge from my school assignment.
You can change it to an tag or list item. just remember to the name your main nav that have dropdown (sub menu) with "dropdown-toggle". Plus change the jquery file from 	$( '.dropdown-toggle' ).click( function( e ) to hover or 	$( '.dropdown-toggle' ).focusin( function( e ) if you want the dropdown  to show when it is hover is focus in.
